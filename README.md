# Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) 

This page contains all codes for running the SSA to produce synthetic data for my PhD project. Here are some of the biological networks I'm currently working on:

- Simple telegraph model
- Telegraph model with the inclusion of protein production and degradation

Initially, to validate whether the codes written are producing expected results, I check their Fano factors too.

I will also move onto using Julia after familiarising myself with how to design and run this algorithm.
