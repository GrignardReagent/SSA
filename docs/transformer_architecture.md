# Transformer Architecture Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the transformer model architecture for time series classification and regression tasks.

## Key Architectural Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Transformer Encoder
- **Pre-Layer Normalization**: Added `norm_first=True` to apply layer normalization before attention, which improves training stability
- **Dimension Increase**: Set `dim_feedforward=4*d_model` to increase the expressive power of the feedforward network

### 2. Feature Extraction & Pre-processing
- **Conv1D Pre-processing**: Option to apply CNN layers before the transformer to extract local temporal features
- **Variable Sequence Length Support**: Added attention masking for handling variable-length sequences

### 3. Advanced Pooling Strategies
The model now supports three pooling strategies:
- **Last Token (`'last'`)**: Uses the representation from the last token
- **Mean Pooling (`'mean'`)**: Global average pooling across the sequence length
- **Learnable Pooling (`'learnable'`)**: Weighted pooling with learnable attention weights

### 4. Training Optimizations
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients during training
- **OneCycleLR Scheduler**: Learning rate warmup and cosine annealing for better convergence
- **Weight Initialization**: Xavier initialization for transformer components, He initialization for fully connected layers
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation performance

### 5. Multi-task Learning
- **Auxiliary Task Support**: Option to add an auxiliary task (e.g., peak count prediction) alongside the main classification task

## Usage Example

```python
# Basic transformer
model = TransformerClassifier(
    input_size=5,      # Number of features per time step
    d_model=64,        # Model dimension
    nhead=4,           # Number of attention heads
    num_layers=2,      # Number of transformer layers
    output_size=3,     # Number of classes
)

# Advanced transformer with all enhancements
model = TransformerClassifier(
    input_size=5,
    d_model=128,
    nhead=8,
    num_layers=4,
    output_size=3,
    dropout_rate=0.3,
    optimizer='AdamW',
    use_conv1d=True,               # Use CNN preprocessing
    use_auxiliary=True,            # Enable auxiliary task
    pooling_strategy='mean',       # Use mean pooling
    use_mask=True,                 # Use attention masking
    gradient_clip=1.0,             # Apply gradient clipping
)
```

## Performance Comparison

Our demo script runs five different configurations:

1. **Basic Transformer**: Default configuration
2. **With Conv1D**: Added CNN layers for preprocessing
3. **With Mean Pooling**: Uses mean pooling instead of last token
4. **With Learnable Pooling**: Uses learnable attention weights for pooling
5. **Advanced Configuration**: Combines all the improvements

Results on a synthetic dataset:

```
Basic Transformer: 0.7167
With Conv1D: 0.4111
With Mean Pooling: 0.8111
With Learnable Pooling: 0.6833
Advanced Configuration: 0.7000
```

In this case, **mean pooling** shows the best performance, suggesting that all time steps contain useful information for the classification task.

## Future Work

These improvements establish a solid foundation, but there are further enhancements that could be explored:

1. **Mixed Precision Training**: Using FP16/BFloat16 to speed up training on GPUs
2. **Transformer-XL**: Adding recurrence for even longer sequence modeling
3. **Stochastic Depth**: Randomly dropping layers during training for better regularization
4. **LayerDrop**: Systematically dropping transformer layers for efficiency
5. **Cross Attention**: For multimodal time series data
6. **Attention Visualization**: Adding methods to visualize the attention weights

## Implementation Details

The improvements are implemented in two main classes:
- `TransformerClassifier`: For classification tasks
- `TransformerRegressor`: For regression tasks

Both classes share similar architectures and utilities, such as weight initialization, gradient clipping, and learning rate scheduling.

The high-level wrapper function `transformer_classifier()` in `transformer_classifier.py` makes these features easily accessible.
